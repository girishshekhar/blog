Over the years, I’ve found myself being asked the same kinds of questions again and again:

- *Can we clone Girish?*
- *How do you scale beyond 1:1 mentoring?*
- *How do you scale beyond group mentoring?*
- *How do you spread your mental models so decisions can be made in your absence?*
- *How do you write more consistently?*

Individually, these questions are reasonable. Collectively, they point to a deeper issue:

> **Impact doesn’t scale if it only exists in conversations.**

At first, I treated these as one-off conversations — hallway chats, coffee catch-ups, Slack threads, mentoring sessions. Over time, it became clear that this approach doesn’t scale—neither for me nor for the people I’m trying to help.

What became increasingly clear was this:  
**the bottleneck wasn’t intent or effort — it was reach.**

Writing is a better multiplier.

When ideas are written down, they:
- persist,
- can be referenced,
- can be challenged,
- and can be reused without my presence,
- scale thinking,
- preserve context,
- create durable artifacts others can build on

Discussing with my manager, I decided to start writing more deliberately—not as an obligation, but as a way to scale learning and thinking beyond the room I’m in.

## The Goal

This blog is an attempt to externalize how I think.

I want to:
- Share mental models I use when making engineering and leadership decisions
- Write about system design, trade-offs, and architecture at scale
- Capture lessons learned the hard way so others don’t have to
- Create a space where ideas can evolve over time instead of disappearing into chat history

This isn’t meant to be a polished authority blog. It’s a working notebook—public, imperfect, and iterative.

If even one post helps someone make a better decision when I’m not around, it’s worth it.

## What to Expect

You can expect writing around:
- Distributed systems and scalability
- Engineering leadership and decision-making
- Design trade-offs in real systems
- Career growth and mentorship at scale

And occasionally, thoughts that are still forming.
